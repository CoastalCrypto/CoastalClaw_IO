## What is Coastal.AI?

Coastal.AI is an open-source **AI Agent Operating System** that runs entirely on your own hardware. No cloud subscription, no API keys, no data leaving your machine.

It gives you a private command center for AI: chat with intelligent agents that know your organisation, schedule them to run automatically, build custom tools they can call, and push results to Telegram, Discord, or Slack — all through a clean web interface.

**Who is this for?**
- Anyone who wants a private, local alternative to cloud AI services
- Teams that want shared AI agents with role-based access control
- Developers who want to build and automate with AI tools
- Power users who want AI running on their own hardware 24/7

---

## 🗺 Choose Your Path

Coastal.AI runs three different ways. Pick the one that fits your situation:

---

### Path 1 — Install on your existing computer *(recommended for most people)*

Runs alongside your current OS (Mac, Linux, or Windows). Nothing is erased. You can stop and start it whenever you want.

**Best for:** personal use, development, trying it out

→ **[Jump to Quick Start](#-quick-start)**

---

### Path 2 — Install as a system service on a Linux server

Installs as a `systemd` service that starts automatically on boot. Ideal for a dedicated machine, home server, or VPS.

**Best for:** always-on setups, team deployments, production use

→ **[Jump to Server Install](#ubuntu--debian--apt-install)**

---

### Path 3 — Boot from USB as a standalone OS (CoastalOS)

Flash a bootable USB drive. Plug it into any UEFI machine and boot — no installation, nothing written to the host disk. CoastalOS is a minimal Linux environment built entirely around Coastal.AI.

**Best for:** dedicated AI appliances, air-gapped setups, taking your AI anywhere

→ **[Jump to CoastalOS](#-coastalos--standalone-os)**

## ✨ Features

| Feature | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Chat** | Talk to AI agents that know your organisation, remember past conversations, and can use tools |
| **Persistent Sessions** | Chat history survives page navigation — your conversation stays intact as you move around the UI |
| **Agent Voice** | Each agent speaks responses aloud — choose from browser voices or the built-in VibeVoice engine |
| **Hardware-Aware Tiers** | On boot, Coastal.AI probes your VRAM and RAM to automatically assign a performance tier (Lite, Standard, or Apex) and optimize model selection |
| **Ollama Auto-Scan** | On startup, Coastal.AI scans your local Ollama install, imports every model it finds, and auto-assigns them to routing domains — no manual configuration needed |
| **Model Routing** | Messages are automatically routed to the right model (high / medium / low priority) based on domain (COO, CFO, CTO, general) — hot-reloads if you change the registry |
| **Ollama Pull** | Pull any model from the Ollama library directly from the Models page with live progress |
| **HuggingFace Install** | Download and quantize HuggingFace models (Q4, Q5, Q8) directly from the web UI |
| **Skills Library** | Save reusable prompt templates with fill-in variables, triggered with `/command` shortcuts in chat |
| **Skill Packs** | Bundle, export, and import curated sets of skills and agents via the Skill Pack API — the foundation of the local AI marketplace |
| **Scheduled Agents** | Set agents to run automatically on a cron schedule — daily briefings, alerts, reports |
| **Multi-Agent Swarm** | Send complex tasks to a team of specialist agents (COO, CFO, CTO) that work in parallel |
| **Pipeline Builder** | Chain agents in sequence — each agent's output becomes the next agent's input. Save pipelines to a library and reload them instantly |
| **Live Pipeline Execution** | Watch pipelines run in real time — stage threads stream every tool call live, with a progress timeline and status badges |
| **Live Steering** | Type a message into the steer bar during any pipeline run and it's injected into the active agent on its next reasoning step |
| **Pipeline Loop-Back** | Configure loop-back arrows on any stage — the runner re-executes a stage until a condition is met, up to a configurable iteration cap |
| **Pipeline Run History** | Browse past pipeline runs from the 🕐 Runs panel, replay their live execution view, and see status badge, duration, and timestamp at a glance |
| **Chat Voice Playback** | Each chat pane has a per-pane 🔊/🔇 toggle — replies are read aloud via the browser speech engine (muted by default; prevents multi-pane collision) |
| **Chat Retry** | Hover the last assistant reply and click ↺ retry to re-send the previous prompt without retyping |
| **Live Dashboard** | Real-time event feed with expandable detail panels — click any tool call, stage, or pipeline event to see the full JSON payload inline |
| **Analytics** | Tool call stats, success rates, cost tracking, 7-day trends |
| **Custom Tools** | Write JavaScript tools in the browser — agents call them automatically |
| **Output Channels** | Push agent messages to Telegram, Discord, Slack, or Zapier |
| **Dynamic MCP Host** | Connect Coastal.AI to any Model Context Protocol (MCP) server — instantly give agents access to Google Drive, Postgres, Slack, and more |
| **High-Performance Data** | Ultra-fast local analysis of million-row CSV/JSON datasets via the CFO agent, powered by the Rust-based Polars engine |
| **Multi-User Auth** | Username + password login with three roles: admin, operator, viewer |
| **Self-Build Loop** | The system can read its own code, propose improvements, and open pull requests |
| **Privacy First** | Entirely local inference — no external API keys or cloud accounts required |

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Data

Coastal.AI is built around a single principle: **your data never leaves your hardware.**

| Component | Where it runs | Data sent externally? |
|-----------|--------------|----------------------|
| Language models | Ollama / vLLM / AirLLM — on your machine | ❌ Never |
| Conversation memory | SQLite in `./data/` — on your machine | ❌ Never |
| Vector search | Infinity DB — on your machine (optional) | ❌ Never |
| Agent tools | Executed locally in a sandboxed workspace | ❌ Never |
| Mem0 semantic memory | **Cloud service (opt-in only)** | ⚠️ Only if you enable it |

### Cloud Features (Opt-In Only)

Some optional features send data to external services. **None are enabled by default.** Each requires your explicit consent before activating:

- **Mem0** — Sends conversation summaries to [Mem0's cloud API](https://mem0.ai) for long-term semantic memory. Requires setting `MEM0_API_KEY` AND granting consent in **Settings → Cloud Features**.

> You will be shown a clear warning and asked to confirm before any data leaves your device.

---

## 🛡 Sandbox Mode

Coastal.AI agents can run shell commands, write files, and execute code. The **trust level** controls how much isolation they have:

| Level | What it means | When to use |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| `trusted` *(default)* | Agents run in your user account — same access as you | Local single-user installs, development |
| `sandboxed` | Agents run in a Linux namespace with overlayfs isolation | Linux servers, multi-user setups, production |
| `autonomous` | Agents run without approval gates | Advanced automation only |

### Default: Trusted

The default trust level is `trusted`. This means:
- ✅ All data stays on your device
- ✅ No network calls to external services
- ⚠️ Agents have the same filesystem access as your user account

### Enabling Sandbox (Linux only)

To enable full sandbox isolation on Linux:

```bash
# Option 1: environment variable
CC_TRUST_LEVEL=sandboxed node packages/core/dist/main.js

# Option 2: persistent file (survives restarts)
echo "sandboxed" > ./data/.trust-level
```

> Sandbox mode uses Linux `unshare` + overlayfs. It is not available on macOS or Windows (falls back to `trusted` automatically).

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Before you begin — what you need

| Requirement | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| Mac or Linux computer | Windows users: use [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) |
| Terminal / command line | To run the install script |
| ~3 GB free disk space | For the AI model and app |
| Internet connection | For first-time setup only — downloads the AI model |

> **New to terminals?** On Mac, press `Cmd + Space`, type "Terminal", and press Enter. On Linux, press `Ctrl + Alt + T`.

---

### Step 1 — Run the installer

> **⚠️ Antivirus & Firewall notice**
>
> Coastal.AI downloads Node.js, Ollama, and an AI model (~2 GB) during setup. Your antivirus or firewall may flag or block these downloads — this is a false positive. The installer only pulls software from official sources (nodejs.org, ollama.com, HuggingFace).
>
> **Windows users:** Windows Defender SmartScreen may show a warning when you run the script. Click **"More info" → "Run anyway"** to proceed. If your antivirus quarantines the installer, add your Downloads folder as a temporary exception, then re-run.
>
> **Mac users:** Gatekeeper may block Ollama on first launch with *"cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified"*. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security** and click **"Open Anyway"** next to the blocked item.
>
> **Firewall:** If your firewall blocks outbound connections, you'll need to allow `nodejs.org`, `ollama.com`, and `huggingface.co` during the initial setup. Once installed, Coastal.AI runs entirely offline — no ongoing internet access is required.

---

**Mac / Linux** — open Terminal and paste:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoastalCrypto/Coastal.AI/master/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows** — open **PowerShell as Administrator** (`Right-click Start → Windows PowerShell (Admin)`) and run these three commands one at a time:

```powershell
# 1. Download the installer
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoastalCrypto/Coastal.AI/master/install.ps1" -OutFile "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\Coastal.AI-install.ps1"

# 2. Unblock it (Windows flags downloaded scripts by default)
Unblock-File "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\Coastal.AI-install.ps1"

# 3. Run it
& "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\Coastal.AI-install.ps1"
```

> **Why not `curl` or `irm | iex`?** PowerShell's `curl` is a different tool that doesn't understand Unix flags. The `irm | iex` one-liner gets blocked by antivirus. Downloading first and running separately lets your AV scan the file before it runs.

The installer will automatically:
- Install Git (if needed)
- Install Node.js (if needed)
- Install Ollama (the local AI engine)
- Download the AI model (~2 GB — this takes a few minutes on first run)
- Install Coastal.AI and its dependencies
- Start the app

When it finishes you'll see:

```
  ✔  Coastal.AI is running!

  Web portal:  http://127.0.0.1:5173
  Core API:    http://127.0.0.1:4747
```

Your browser will open automatically. If it doesn't, go to **http://127.0.0.1:5173** manually.

---

### Step 2 — Create your admin account

The first time you open Coastal.AI you'll see a setup screen. Choose a username and password — this creates your admin account.

> Write down your password somewhere safe. There is no "forgot password" recovery built in yet.

---

### Step 3 — Set up your persona

After logging in, the **Persona Setup** wizard will appear. Fill in:

- **Agent name** — what you want your AI assistant to call itself (e.g. "Aria")
- **Your name** — so the agent addresses you personally
- **Organization name** — your company or project name
- **Organization description** — 2–3 sentences about what your org does

This is saved once and injected into every agent in the system. You can change it anytime in **Settings**.

---

That's it. You're up and running.

---

## 🗺 First Boot Walkthrough

Here's a quick tour of the main areas:

### Chat

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/chat.png" alt="Chat interface" width="80%"/>
</p>

The main chat window. Type a message and press Enter. The agent responds with its name and voice (if configured).

**Tips:**
- Type `/` to browse your saved skills (prompt shortcuts)
- The agent remembers previous conversations in the same session
- Upload files (text, CSV, JSON) with the paperclip button

---

### Dashboard

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/dashboard.png" alt="Dashboard" width="80%"/>
</p>

The **Dashboard** shows a live feed of everything happening — every tool call, session, and agent action in real time.

The top section shows your **Scheduled Jobs** (cron tasks). You can:
- Create a new scheduled task (e.g. "every day at 9am, summarize the news")
- Run any job immediately with the Play button
- Pause or delete jobs

---

### Agents

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/agents.png" alt="Agent editor" width="80%"/>
</p>

The **Agents** page lets you create and configure each AI agent. For each agent you can set:
- Name, role, and personality
- Which AI model it uses
- Its **voice** — pick from browser voices or the built-in VibeVoice engine
- Trust tier (sandboxed / trusted / autonomous)

Click **Preview** next to any voice to hear a sample before saving.

---

### Meet the Agents

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/agent-characters.png" alt="Coastal.AI built-in agent characters" width="90%"/>
</p>

Coastal.AI ships with **9 built-in specialist agents**, each with its own domain, personality, and illustrated character. Click any character in the left sidebar of the Chat page to switch into a conversation with that agent.

| Character | Role | Domain |
|-----------|------|--------|
| 🤖 **General Assistant** | Your everyday AI companion — answers questions, drafts text, runs tools, and routes tasks to the right specialist. | General |
| 💰 **CFO** | Chief Financial Officer. Tracks ledgers, models cash flow, analyses crypto positions, and spots financial risks. | Finance |
| 🖥️ **CTO** | Chief Technology Officer. Reviews architecture, evaluates tech choices, reads logs, and drives engineering decisions. | Tech |
| ⚙️ **COO** | Chief Operating Officer. Coordinates workflows, schedules operations, monitors KPIs, and keeps the business running smoothly. | Operations |
| 🗺️ **Product Manager** | Owns the roadmap. Writes specs, prioritises features, tracks milestones, and keeps the team focused on what ships next. | Product |
| 🔥 **Front-End Wizard** | UI/UX engineer. Writes components, reviews designs, debugs layouts, and turns Figma frames into production code. | Frontend |
| 🐙 **UX Architect** | Maps user flows, runs heuristic reviews, designs information architecture, and champions accessible experiences. | UX |
| 🔍 **QA Lead** | Hunts bugs, writes test plans, reviews edge cases, and won't let anything ship until it's been properly tortured. | QA |
| 🔌 **System Integrator** | Wires services together — APIs, webhooks, databases, message queues, and anything else that needs to talk to anything else. | Systems |

Each agent uses the same underlying model but has a tailored system prompt that shapes its reasoning, vocabulary, and priorities. You can create additional custom agents on the **Agents** page.

---

### Skills

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/skills.png" alt="Skills library" width="80%"/>
</p>

**Skills** are reusable prompt templates. Create one with variable slots like `{{topic}}` and `{{audience}}`, then call it from chat with `/skill-name`. A fill-in panel appears for the variables before the prompt is sent.

Example skill — *Blog Post Outline*:
```
Write a blog post outline about {{topic}} targeted at {{audience}}.
Use {{sections}} sections. Tone: {{tone}}.
```

---

### Analytics

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/analytics.png" alt="Analytics" width="80%"/>
</p>

The **Analytics** page shows usage stats across all agents: total sessions, tool call success rates, average response time, cost breakdown, and a 7-day activity chart.

---

### Tools

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/tools.png" alt="Custom tool builder" width="80%"/>
</p>

The **Tools** page lets you write custom JavaScript tools that agents can call. Write the function body, define its parameters, test it with sample input — all from the browser. No restart required.

---

### Pipeline Builder

The **Pipeline** page lets you chain agents together. Each agent's output becomes the next agent's input — build arbitrarily long sequences and save them to your library.

**Building a pipeline:**
1. Click **+ Add Stage** and select an agent for each step
2. Optionally add a **↩ loop-back** on any stage — set a condition string and max iterations; the runner re-runs that stage until the output contains the condition text
3. Give it a name and click **Save** to store it in the library
4. Enter an initial prompt and click **▶ Run Pipeline**

The page immediately navigates to the **Live Execution View**.

---

### Live Pipeline Execution

Once a pipeline starts, you're taken to a live view with three sections:

- **Timeline** — a horizontal row of stage dots (done ✓ / active pulse / waiting ○) that updates as each stage completes
- **Stage threads** — each stage is a collapsible card. The active stage is expanded and shows every tool call streaming in real time, with function name, arguments, and result. Done stages collapse automatically.
- **Steer bar** — type any message and hit **Send** to inject it into the active agent's next reasoning step. Steered messages appear inline in amber so you can see exactly where your input landed.

Click **Abort** at any time to cancel the run, or **← Back** when it completes to return to the builder.

---

### Channels

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/channels.png" alt="Output channels" width="80%"/>
</p>

**Channels** push agent messages out to external services. Add a Telegram bot, Discord webhook, Slack webhook, or Zapier hook — then agents can send messages there automatically, or you can broadcast manually.

---

## 💿 CoastalOS — Standalone OS

> **This is Path 3.** CoastalOS boots from a USB drive as a complete, self-contained operating system — no existing OS required on the host machine.

CoastalOS is a dedicated Linux image that runs Coastal.AI as a complete operating system. Boot from a USB drive — no installation required, nothing written to your machine's disk.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/screenshots/coastalos-desktop.png" alt="CoastalOS desktop" width="80%"/>
</p>

### What you need

- USB drive **8 GB or larger** (all data on it will be erased)
- Latest ISO from the [Releases page](https://github.com/CoastalCrypto/Coastal.AI/releases)

---

### Writing the ISO to USB

**Easiest method (all platforms) — Balena Etcher:**

1. Download [Balena Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io) and open it
2. Click **Flash from file** → select the `.iso` file
3. Click **Select target** → select your USB drive
4. Click **Flash** and wait (~5 minutes)

That's all. Eject the drive when done.

---

**Mac (Terminal method):**

```bash
# Step 1: Find your USB drive name (look for "external" in the list)
diskutil list

# Step 2: Unmount it (replace disk2 with your drive)
diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk2

# Step 3: Write the ISO (replace disk2 and the filename)
sudo dd if=~/Downloads/coastalos-1.0.0.iso of=/dev/rdisk2 bs=4m status=progress

# Step 4: Eject
diskutil eject /dev/disk2
```

> Use `/dev/rdisk2` (with the `r`) — it's faster than `/dev/disk2`.

---

**Linux (Terminal method):**

```bash
# Step 1: Find your USB drive (look for your drive size)
lsblk

# Step 2: Write the ISO (replace sdb and the filename)
sudo dd if=~/Downloads/coastalos-1.0.0.iso of=/dev/sdb bs=4M status=progress oflag=sync
```

> Double-check the drive letter (`sdb`, `sdc`, etc.) — writing to the wrong device will erase it.

---

### Booting from USB

1. Plug the USB drive into the computer you want to run CoastalOS on
2. Restart the computer
3. When the logo appears, press the boot menu key:
   - **Most PCs:** `F12`, `F11`, or `F9`
   - **HP:** `F9`
   - **Dell:** `F12`
   - **Lenovo:** `F12`
   - **Mac:** Hold `Option ⌥` immediately after the chime
4. Select your USB drive from the list
5. CoastalOS boots in ~30–60 seconds and opens the interface fullscreen

**Notes:**
- Your data (memory, persona, users) is stored on the USB — take it anywhere
- The AI model (~2 GB) is downloaded on first boot — internet required
- Requires UEFI firmware (most machines from 2012 onward)

---

## 🔧 Stopping and Starting

### If you installed with the install script

**Mac / Linux:**
```bash
# Stop
kill $(cat /tmp/coastal-ai-core.pid /tmp/coastal-ai-web.pid) 2>/dev/null

# Start again
bash install.sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
# Stop
Stop-Process -Id (Get-Content $env:TEMP\coastal-ai-core.pid) -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Stop-Process -Id (Get-Content $env:TEMP\coastal-ai-web.pid)  -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Start again (re-run the installer you downloaded)
& "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\Coastal.AI-install.ps1"
```

### If you installed via APT (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
sudo systemctl stop Coastal.AI
sudo systemctl start Coastal.AI
sudo systemctl status Coastal.AI   # check it's running
```

---

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to try |
|---------|-------------|
| Browser didn't open | Go to `http://127.0.0.1:5173` manually |
| "Port already in use" | Run `kill $(cat /tmp/coastal-ai-core.pid)` then restart |
| First response is very slow | Normal — the AI model loads into memory on first use (~30s) |
| Agent not responding | Check logs: `tail -f /tmp/coastal-ai-core.log` |
| Forgot your password | Delete `./data/users.db` and re-run setup (this resets all users) |
| Install script failed | Make sure you have `curl` installed: `which curl` |

---

## Ubuntu / Debian — APT install

For servers and production setups, install as a system service:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://CoastalCrypto.github.io/Coastal.AI/setup.sh | sudo bash
```

This adds the signed APT repository and installs `Coastal.AI` as a systemd service that starts automatically on boot.

---

## 🎭 Agent Persona

Set once in the **Settings** page — applied to all agents.

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Agent Name | What your assistant calls itself | `Aria` |
| Agent Role | One-line role description | `Executive Assistant` |
| Personality | Free-text traits | `Professional, concise, proactive` |
| Org Name | Your organization | `Acme Corp` |
| Org Context | 2–4 sentences about your org | `We build fintech software...` |
| Owner Name | Your name — agents address you by this | `Jordan` |

---

## 🤖 Scheduled Agents (Cron Jobs)

Agents can run automatically on a schedule without any user input. Configure them from the **Dashboard**.

**Example schedules:**

| What you type | When it runs |
|---------------|-------------|
| `0 8 * * 1-5` | Weekdays at 8:00 AM |
| `0 */2 * * *` | Every 2 hours |
| `0 9 * * 1` | Every Monday at 9 AM |
| `30 17 * * 5` | Every Friday at 5:30 PM |

> Not familiar with cron syntax? Use [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru) to build schedules visually.

---

## 🐝 Multi-Agent Swarm

For complex tasks, Coastal.AI can coordinate multiple specialist agents in parallel. Send a task to the team and get a synthesized result from the COO, CFO, and CTO agents working together.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4747/api/team/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"task": "Analyze Q2 financials and prepare a board summary"}'
```

---

## 📣 Output Channels

Push agent messages to external services. Set up in the **Channels** tab.

| Channel | What you need |
|---------|--------------|
| **Telegram** | A Telegram bot token + your chat ID |
| **Discord** | A webhook URL from your server settings |
| **Slack** | A webhook URL from your workspace |
| **Zapier** | A catch-hook URL from your Zap |

All config is stored encrypted. You can test each channel individually or broadcast a message to all enabled channels at once.

---

### Trust Tiers

| Tier | What agents can do |
|------|-------------------|
| `sandboxed` (default) | Isolated container — can't touch your files or system |
| `trusted` | Host shell access, restricted to the workspace directory |
| `autonomous` | Full unrestricted host shell — use with caution |

### User Roles

| Role | What they can access |
|------|---------------------|
| `admin` | Everything — all pages, user management, models, tools, channels |
| `operator` | Chat, dashboard, analytics — no user or model management |
| `viewer` | Chat and dashboard only |

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment variables

You can customize behavior by setting these before starting the app (or in a `.env` file):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `CC_PORT` | `4747` | API server port |
| `CC_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address (`0.0.0.0` to expose on network) |
| `CC_DATA_DIR` | `./data` | Where data is stored (SQLite, persona, etc.) |
| `CC_OLLAMA_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:11434` | Ollama endpoint |
| `CC_DEFAULT_MODEL` | `llama3.2` | AI model to use |
| `CC_TRUST_LEVEL` | `sandboxed` | Agent trust tier |
| `CC_AGENT_WORKDIR` | `./data/workspace` | Agent sandbox folder |
| `CC_VLLM_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8000` | vLLM endpoint (optional, auto-probed) |
| `CC_AIRLLM_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8002` | AirLLM endpoint (optional, auto-probed) |
| `CC_VIBEVOICE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8001` | VibeVoice TTS (optional, auto-probed) |
| `CC_CORS_ORIGINS` | `localhost:5173` | Allowed origins for the web UI |
| `CC_VRAM_BUDGET_GB` | `24` | GPU VRAM ceiling for model selection |

---

## 🔒 Security

### Protecting a production install

If you're running Coastal.AI on a server (not just locally), follow these steps:

- [ ] Put it behind a reverse proxy (nginx or Caddy) with HTTPS/TLS
- [ ] Set `CC_CORS_ORIGINS` to your actual domain
- [ ] Set `CC_HOST` to `127.0.0.1` (don't expose the API port directly)
- [ ] Put `CC_DATA_DIR` on encrypted storage
- [ ] Start with `sandboxed` trust tier
- [ ] Set a strong admin password

### API authentication

```bash
# Create admin account (first boot only)
curl -X POST http://localhost:4747/api/auth/setup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "admin", "password": "your-password"}'

# Login — returns a session token
curl -X POST http://localhost:4747/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "admin", "password": "your-password"}'

# Use the token on admin endpoints
curl http://localhost:4747/api/admin/channels \
  -H "x-admin-session: <your-session-token>"
```

Session tokens are HMAC-SHA256 signed with a 7-day TTL. Passwords are stored with scrypt (N=32768, r=8, p=1).
